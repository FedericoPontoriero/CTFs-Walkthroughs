#+title: 1 Obedient Cat
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
This file has a flag in plain sight (aka "in-the-clear").
#+END_QUOTE

** Solution
This is a very simple challenge, the only thing we need to do is to download
the file that is provided clicking it or using wget and the path to the file.

Then we will notice that the flag file has no extension, so we can't open it just
by double clicking on it. But what we can do is use a text editor or simply using

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cat flag
#+END_SRC
on the directory where we downloaded the file and it will give us the flag.

We can then copy it using the mouse or piping the output to xclip or some other
clipboard utility and then paste it in Pico.
